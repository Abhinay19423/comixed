## Feature Requests Should Go To The Mailing List First

Rather than creating a feature request tickets, it's strongly recommended that you instead post your feature
request to the [user list](https://www.freelists.org/list/comixed). This will allow more people to be involved
in defining the feature, and help the developers understand the request better.
